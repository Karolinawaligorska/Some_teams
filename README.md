This is my first php-assignment at Yrgo.
Our assignment was to organize and distribute data in to different php files. The original data is to be found in data.php.

Since I am still in the early stages of learning php I usually comment inside my code to help me visualise and further understand certain functions. 
I understand that this could be a little annoying to read but bear with me!

Best regards, Karolina
